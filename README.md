Contribution guide 

In this document I will outline the procedure we use to allow all team members to contribute to the source code. In order to let everyone edit the code, we setup a git repository.  This means that team members can make changes to the code and push changes back to the repository. Within our team we created a set of rules to follow in order to make this process as simple as possible which can be seen below:
•	Before making any changes, check with the rest of the team that the changes are wanted and necessary.
•	Include documentation and comments with any changes you make to help the other team members understand
•	Only merge the pull request once every other team member has explicitly said that there fine with it
Within our group we want to ensure that every member feels welcome and included in the project. Every team member should treat each other with respect and no rude behaviour or discrimination of any kind will be tolerated. If anyone in the team feels like the are being treated unfairly then we encourage them to speak up and contact the project manager or another team member on MS Teams. From here the PM can bring it up to the group and together make the appropriate decision and try to resolve any issues.

Our standards 

In this section I will go through the standards that our group hold. By following these rules, we will create a happy and welcoming environment for the team to work in. This should lead to a better end project as well as healthy working relationship within the team.
•	Each member of the team must be respectful to each other and not use any inappropriate language
•	The team should split the work equally and each member should try to help each other out. If someone is stuck, they should bring it up with the team without any judgment from the other members.
•	Each member of the team should be able to freely give and receive constructive criticism without taking offence. If someone feels like the criticism is unfair, they should bring it up with the project manager.
•	Each person should be willing to compromise on their ideas, when it comes to the project, in order to create a better application.
